## About

#### CVDs (cardiovascular diseases) are the leading cause of death globally. In this project I try to predict whether a patient suffers or not from this type of heart disorders. For that purpose I compare the performace of four classification algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree 
- Support Vector Machine
#### After tuning hyperparameters, the classifier with the best results is used to build a simple web-app where the user can insert some personal information and get the predicted result. 

#### Web-app is hosted by Heroku and you can visit it by clicking https://cvdspredictor.herokuapp.com/.

#### Note: Report was set in the form of Jupyter Notebook. Since github does not render plotly figures, I recommend reading it via the following link that leads to the nbviewer preview https://nbviewer.org/github/superion30/ML_project/blob/main/report_.ipynb

## Run Script

#### In case you want to run the code.py locally you can use the following commands on your terminal 
- clone repo 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/superion30/ML_project.git
```
- set up a virtual environment 
```bash
virtualenv venv --distribute
```
- jump into the virtual environment
```bash
. venv/bin/activate
```
- head to the repo directory and install requirements 
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
- run the .py file you'd like
```bash
python3 code.py
```
