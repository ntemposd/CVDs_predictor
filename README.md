#### CVDs (cardiovascular diseases) are the leading cause of death globally. In this project I try to predict whether a patient suffers or not from this type of heart disorders. For that purpose I compare the performace of four classification algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree 
- Support Vector Machine
#### Tuning hyperparameters, best classifier is used to build a simple web-app where the user can insert some personal information and get the predicted result.

#### Note: Report was set in the form of Jupyter Notebook. Since github does not render plotly figures, I recommend reading it via the following link that leads to the nbviewer preview https://nbviewer.org/github/superion30/ML_project/blob/main/report_.ipynb
